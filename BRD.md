# Business Requirements Document: Prometheus Lens

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2024-06-24  
**Author:** App Prototyper (Firebase Studio)

## 1. Executive Summary

Prometheus Lens is a web-based application designed to simplify the management and monitoring of infrastructure and application assets using Prometheus. The primary goal is to provide a centralized, user-friendly interface for defining, organizing, and generating Prometheus `scrape_configs` for various asset types. It abstracts away the complexity of manually writing YAML configurations, provides clear setup instructions for different monitoring exporters, and organizes assets into a logical folder structure, all backed by a robust PostgreSQL database and deployed via Docker.

## 2. Business Objectives

*   **BO-1: Simplify Configuration:** Reduce the time and complexity required for DevOps engineers and developers to configure Prometheus monitoring for new and existing assets.
*   **BO-2: Centralize Management:** Provide a single source of truth for all monitored asset configurations, improving organization and visibility.
*   **BO-3: Improve Onboarding:** Offer clear, step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring necessary Prometheus exporters (e.g., Node Exporter, cAdvisor), reducing the learning curve.
*   **BO-4: Enhance Scalability:** Create a scalable system by using a PostgreSQL database for data persistence and a containerized deployment model with Docker.

## 3. Project Scope

### 3.1. In Scope

*   **Asset Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for monitoring assets.
*   **Folder Organization:** Full CRUD functionality for folders to logically group assets.
*   **Configuration Generation:** UI-driven generation of Prometheus `scrape_configs` for individual assets.
*   **Aggregated Configuration View:** A read-only page that displays the combined `scrape_configs` for all managed assets.
*   **Instructional Guides:** Providing clear, context-specific setup instructions for various asset types (e.g., Servers, Docker, Kubernetes, Databases).
*   **User & Group Management (Mock):** A UI for managing users, groups, and permissions (currently using mock data).
*   **Containerized Deployment:** The application is fully configured to run via Docker and Docker Compose with a PostgreSQL database.

### 3.2. Out of Scope

*   **Automatic `prometheus.yml` Deployment:** The application generates configuration snippets but does not automatically write to or reload the `prometheus.yml` file on a remote Prometheus server. This remains a manual user action.
*   **Real-time Alerting:** The application does not include functionality for defining or managing Prometheus alerting rules.
*   **Metrics Visualization:** While Grafana links are supported, Prometheus Lens is not a data visualization or dashboarding tool itself.
*   **Live User Authentication:** The user management system is currently a mock and does not include a live authentication/authorization flow.

## 6. Style Guide

This guide ensures a consistent and professional look and feel across the Prometheus Lens application.

### 6.1. Tone of Voice

*   **Professional & Helpful:** Communication should be clear, concise, and aimed at empowering the user.
*   **Authoritative but Not Arrogant:** Provide expert guidance without being condescending.
*   **Clear & Direct:** Use simple language. Avoid unnecessary jargon. When technical terms are needed, they should be used correctly in context (e.g., `scrape_config`, `relabel_configs`).

### 6.2. UI/UX Principles

*   **Modern & Clean:** Prioritize a spacious, uncluttered layout with ample white space.
*   **Component-Based:** Utilize ShadCN UI components for consistency in elements like buttons, cards, dialogs, and inputs.
*   **Glassmorphism:** Use the `glassmorphic` style for key container elements like cards to create a sense of depth and modernity.
*   **Hierarchy:** Use typography, color, and layout to create a clear visual hierarchy. Page titles should be prominent, with descriptions and body content following a logical order.
*   **Feedback:** Provide immediate and clear feedback for user actions (e.g., toasts for success or error on save, loading states).

### 6.3. Color Palette

The color palette is defined by HSL CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css`.

*   **Primary:** `hsl(211, 100%, 50%)` - A strong blue used for primary actions, active states, and key icons.
*   **Background:** `hsl(0, 0%, 100%)` (light mode) / `hsl(222.2, 84%, 4.9%)` (dark mode) - The base page color. A subtle gradient is used for the main layout background.
*   **Card:** `hsl(var(--glass-bg-light))` - A semi-transparent, blurred background for card components.
*   **Accent:** `hsl(211, 100%, 65%)` - A lighter blue used for hover states and secondary highlights.
*   **Destructive:** `hsl(0, 84.2%, 60.2%)` - Red, used for delete actions and error states.
*   **Foreground:** `hsl(222.2, 84%, 4.9%)` (light) / `hsl(210, 40%, 98%)` (dark) - The primary text color.
*   **Muted Foreground:** `hsl(215.4, 16.3%, 46.9%)` (light) / `hsl(215, 20.2%, 65.1%)` (dark) - For descriptive text and secondary information.

### 6.4. Typography

Fonts are defined in `tailwind.config.ts` and imported in `src/app/layout.tsx`.

*   **Headlines:** **Space Grotesk**. Used for all major titles (`<h1-h3>`, `CardTitle`, `DialogTitle`). It provides a modern, technical feel.
*   **Body:** **Inter**. Used for all body copy, paragraphs, labels, and descriptions. It is highly readable and clean.
*   **Code:** **Monospace**. Used for displaying code snippets and YAML/JSON configurations.

### 6.5. Iconography

*   **Library:** **Lucide React**. This is the primary icon library. Icons should be used consistently and purposefully to enhance usability.
*   **Style:** Icons should be clean, line-based, and generally rendered at a size of `h-4 w-4` or `h-5 w-5` for clarity.
